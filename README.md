## Introduction
 
The Ontario Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities proposed a new college in the area that will have curriculum devoted completely to media and design, especially digital media and software design. This website is basically for an educational institution, this website should display the geographical influence on the content and design of the web pages, many students from urban areas will be attractedas well. If the inspiration is to be taken from the native art pieces, it should be donewith great sensitivity to avoid the cliché. The website design should definitely represent the native area. The ultimate goal of this software is to attract the target audience that includes the students, faculty as well as the parents of the students. It should be easily accessible by differently-abled persons with disabilities as

## Needs and Goals

With the diverse audiences that college have to appeal to with our website content, it’s no surprise that we tend to have rather simple page hierarchies with pages divided in sections for better look for things that people actual want to know about the institution. The website displays all of the information with scrolling site designs that are quite user
friendly. It allows you to fit more information on a single page while still keeping it organized and easy to understand.


## Target Market

This website is specially targeted to the students who seek admission and will enroll in the institute and will intensively use this website as the primary target audience. Parents, faculty, etc. are the secondary target audience of this software. This aspect
will surely influence the design as it will be created according to the psychology of a teenager, like using vibrant color schemes, modern and attractive font styles and much more.
